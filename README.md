# :red_circle: OpenVR Input Recorder
Tired of pulling your headset on everytime you change code? 

* Record VR actions once and replay each time you change code
* Test multiplayer VR content without needing multiple headsets
* Replay at 2x to speed up test cycles
* Records motion data and button/trigger presses for all connected devices
* Since tracking data is recorded/injected at the OpenVR driver level, it works with any game engine
